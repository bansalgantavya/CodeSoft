# TO DO List
# In this code, we're keeping things straightforward with basic Pythonâ€”no rocket science needed! ðŸš€

# Here's the deal: We have a list called listdo where all the operations take place.
#  Our while loop will keep running until you type the magic word: 'exit'. 
# Before you leave, don't forget to save your changes!

# Hereâ€™s how you can manage your tasks:
# Add a task: Use the add command followed by the task.
# Remove a task: Use the remove command followed by the task.
# Save your list: Just type the save command.
# View your list: Type the show command to see your to-do list.
# We hope you enjoy using this code and working on the project. 
# And hey, donâ€™t forget to give a star this repo!
